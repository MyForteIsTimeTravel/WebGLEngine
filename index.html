                    The Boden style is the original .strandberg* shape, combining excellent ergonomics with style and aesthetics. 
                    It is named after the city Boden in the north of Sweden, drawing on the resemblance between its shape and reindeer antlers; 
                    there are no wild reindeer left in Sweden, but they are commonly farmed in the north.

                    The specs of the production Boden guitars are taken from the Made to Measure guitars of leading players such as Tosin Abasi, 
                    Misha Mansoor, and Chris Letchford. Materials are chosen to provide a versatile tone, applicable to all types of music, 
                    and all share the common attributes of being quick to respond and “organic” sounding. With a chambered Swamp Ash body, 
                    it normally weighs in between 2 kg/4.4 lbs – 2.3 kg/5 lbs depending on pickups, and yet remains perfectly balanced. 
                    The contoured body shape allows multiple comfortable seated playing positions and the low weight saves your shoulders and neck. 
                    The patented EndurNeck™ shape relaxes muscles, joints, and tendons in your hand, wrist and forearm, and encourages a more correct playing position.  
                    When you feel better, you sound better.
